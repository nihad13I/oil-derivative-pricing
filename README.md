The Evolution of the Model
Standard financial models often struggle with energy markets because they treat price movements like a smooth, predictable walk. In reality, commodities like Brent Crude Oil (BZ=F) are governed by the physical constraints of supply and demand—they naturally pull back toward a "fair" production cost, yet they remain vulnerable to sudden, violent price "jumps" triggered by geopolitical shocks. This project documents a transition from a baseline equilibrium model to a sophisticated Merton Jump-Diffusion framework designed to capture the "Black Swan" events that standard Gaussian models often ignore.

The journey began with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process, a mean-reverting model that serves as the "heartbeat" of the oil market. By applying Ito’s Lemma to five years of historical data, I identified a long-term price equilibrium of $79.75, providing a mathematical "pull" that anchors the price to its historical center. While this captured the market's daily behavior, it couldn't account for the extreme spikes caused by supply disruptions. To bridge this gap, I extended the framework into Phase 2 by integrating a Poisson process. This allowed the model to simulate discrete shocks, while a Log-Normal transformation ensured that the resulting price paths remained within realistic bounds.

The results of this transition were statistically significant. By isolating these jumps, I derived a "Clean Sigma" of 18.0%, which offers a far more accurate view of daily market noise than standard volatility metrics. This modular quantitative pipeline, built entirely in Python, now replicates the "fat-tailed" risk profile seen in actual market data. This is a critical distinction for anyone managing energy portfolios, as it justifies the higher costs of protection against extreme price swings.

Fat-Tail Risk Management: The Jump-Diffusion model successfully identifies the high kurtosis in oil data, which is essential for accurately pricing out-of-the-money (OTM) derivatives that standard models misprice.

Modular Pipeline Architecture: The project has moved away from fragmented environments to a robust, terminal-ready structure, featuring dedicated scripts for calibration, simulation, and formal LaTeX documentation.

Final Thoughts & Future Research
This project provides a full-stack quantitative workflow—from raw data extraction via yfinance to formal stochastic derivation and numerical simulation. By transitioning from a simple equilibrium model to a jump-diffusion framework, we have built a tool that respects the true nature of energy markets: they are mostly stable but defined by their sudden, violent shocks.

Looking ahead, the most critical expansion of this research lies in Multivariate Crack Spread Modeling. While this project successfully models Brent Crude in isolation, a professional trading desk must manage the "spread risk" between crude and its refined counterparts. Future research will focus on utilizing Copula functions to model the non-linear "tail dependence" between Brent Crude and gasoline futures. Unlike standard correlation, this approach captures how these assets behave together during extreme "Black Swan" events, providing a more robust framework for pricing crack spread options and managing refinery hedging portfolios. Ultimately, this research underscores that in energy derivatives, the most critical risks—and the greatest opportunities—often lie in the movements that standard models choose to ignore.
