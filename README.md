Commodity Pricing & Mean Reversion: A Stochastic FrameworkThe modeling of commodity derivatives requires a fundamental departure from standard equity-based frameworks. While equities are typically driven by long-term growth expectations and modeled via Geometric Brownian Motion, commodities such as Brent Crude Oil (BZ=F) are governed by the physical constraints of global supply and demand. This project focuses on the strategic selection of Brent Crude due to its susceptibility to geopolitical and economic shocks, which eventually settle back toward a "natural price" or cost-of-production equilibrium. By analyzing data from February 2026, this project captures the contemporary volatility and pricing dynamics essential for accurate financial engineering.To capture this equilibrium-seeking behavior, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process is employed as the core stochastic model. Unlike the random walk of a stock, the OU process incorporates a mathematical "pull" that increases as the price deviates from its long-term mean. This framework utilizes Ito’s Lemma to bridge the gap between theoretical stochastic differential equations and practical derivative pricing. By transforming the SDE into a solvable form, we can derive the expected future price paths, which is a critical skill for managing risk in energy portfolios and pricing complex futures contracts.The technical implementation of this project follows a modular quantitative pipeline. The process begins with empirical calibration using the yfinance API to extract five years of historical Brent Crude data. This data is used to calculate the annualized volatility and the long-term price equilibrium. Because many stochastic processes do not possess a simple closed-form solution for multi-factor derivatives, the Euler-Maruyama method is implemented for numerical discretization. By simulating thousands of potential price paths with a high-resolution time step ($dt=0.001$), the model provides a robust tool for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and understanding the probability distribution of future energy prices.The results of the calibration identified a long-term price equilibrium ($\theta$) of $79.75 and a realized annualized volatility ($\sigma$) of 33.93%. The historical analysis confirms the asset's tendency to oscillate around this mean, while the stochastic path simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the Euler-Maruyama method in replicating these dynamics. These findings serve as a foundation for future research, which will aim to extend this framework by incorporating Jump-Diffusion processes to account for extreme market crashes and developing multi-factor models to analyze the pricing of gasoline-crude crack spreads.
